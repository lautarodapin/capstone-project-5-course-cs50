### Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements?

This project utilizes ``Django Rest Framework`` for fetch calls from the frontend, and ``WebSockets`` with the ``Channels`` package, for live chat and notifications features.

### Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.
- [chat_project](chat_project/)
    -  Main root of the project, it contains the settings, and urls links.
    - Also contains the ``asgi`` file for routing the websocket calls to the consumers.
- [backend](backend/)

### How to run your application.
``` cmd
> virtualenv venv
> venv/Scripts/activate
> (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
> (venv) python manage.py migrate

Create two users or superusers
> (venv) python manage.py createsuperuser
> (venv) python manage.py createsuperuser
> (venv) python manage.py runserver
```
